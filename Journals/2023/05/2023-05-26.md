# Shirt Size Dilemma

I'm facing a size dilemma with the white formal shirt I want to buy. If I choose size M, the sleeves will fit my arms perfectly, but the collar will be uncomfortably tight. On the other hand, if I opt for size L, the collar will be more comfortable, but the sleeves will be too long. It's a sizing conflict that makes it difficult to find a shirt that fits both my arms and neck comfortably.
