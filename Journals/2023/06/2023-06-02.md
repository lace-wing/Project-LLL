The Children's Day on 1st June originally is not set for joy and happiness, but to commemorate children who suffered and were killed in wars.
Do I understand situations of those children who live in poverty, rootlessness, discrimination and violence?
Certainly no, but hopefuly to a limited extend.
I am a lucky one, born and grew in a good physical environment.
However I often feel powerless, whenever I want to do something to change the society, pushing it forward.
Is that because I have not been trained for volunteering, involving is community matters, or due to lack of mental care so I got a cold blooded personality?
Perhaps both.
How?
