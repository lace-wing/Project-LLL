These days I watched many mouse reviews.
The Logitech mouses are amazing, especially the MX Master 3S.
I was thinking of buying it, but yes, bugget.
So I went up planning to save money.
In that cooldown period, I found an interesting fact, that I don't really need that a functionality mouse.
Instead, I may want a keyboard, possibly an erogonomic one.

With the introduction of mouse, things like user interface have changed a lot to adopt the new nature of 'using a computer'.
The design language of GUI says 'here' rather than '(3, 5)'.
Still, CLI has not fade away yet, and ironically I found it useful as I have been using digital devices all via GUI for more than ten years.

And what...the price of keyboards...? MAN.
