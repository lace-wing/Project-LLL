# Terrifiying Situation

The submersible *Titan* has not been found yet.
By estimation, if the vessel is still deep down in the sea, the 5 people on board should be running out of their oxygen.
Just imagining that situation already horrified me.

In the BBC News it has mentioned that we know less about the deep ocean than the space.
That remind me of the movie *Gravity*, oxygen running out, crews left alone, nobody else could reach there.
The difference is, gravity helped the astronaut to return to the earth, whereas is pulling the submarine to death.
