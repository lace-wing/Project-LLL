# A Day That Something Has Happened and Something Is Happenning

Starlight River mod released its first public alpha (I think it should be called a 'beta'), after four years of development.
Two hours after the release, I published my first translation mod, a Chinese patch for SLR.
Definately a remarkable day.

At the same time, abnormalities of social platforms are reminding me, that something has happened today, and is still happenning.
