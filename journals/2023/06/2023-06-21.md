## Words
**submarine** (noun):

1. A large, self-propelled naval vessel designed to operate both on the surface of the water and underwater, typically armed with weapons and used for military purposes.
2. A vessel or structure that can be submerged and operate underwater, typically used for research, exploration, or military purposes.

**submarine** (adjective):

1. Relating to or characteristic of submarines or their operations.

**submersible** (noun):

1. A small underwater vehicle or vessel designed to operate underwater, often used for research, exploration, or military purposes.

**submersible** (adjective):

1. Capable of being submerged or operating underwater.
2. Designed to operate or function underwater.
3. Able to withstand being immersed in water without damage.

**Difference between "submarine" and "submersible"**:

While both "submarine" and "submersible" refer to vessels or vehicles that can operate underwater, there are some key differences:

- **Size and Purpose**: A submarine is typically a large, self-propelled naval vessel used for military purposes. It is capable of operating on the surface of the water and submerging to operate underwater. On the other hand, a submersible is generally smaller and used for research, exploration, or specialized underwater tasks.

- **Capabilities**: Submarines are equipped with advanced technologies, including weapons systems, navigation systems, and life support systems, allowing them to undertake long-duration missions and operate in various environments. Submersibles, while also capable of operating underwater, may have more specific purposes such as scientific research, deep-sea exploration, or underwater inspections.

- **Design**: Submarines are specifically designed to withstand high water pressures and have the capability to dive and resurface. They are built with a pressure hull that can withstand the forces of submersion. Submersibles, depending on their size and purpose, may not have the same level of structural integrity or extensive life support systems as submarines.

Overall, submarines are larger, more complex vessels primarily used for military applications, while submersibles are smaller, specialized vehicles designed for underwater research, exploration, or specific tasks.
