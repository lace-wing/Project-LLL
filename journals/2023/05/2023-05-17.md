I found that musics can hinder a person's logical thinking ability.
This can be similar to Pathos in persuasive language.
Songs which are played in relegious events are typical persuasive musics.
This feature can utilized in a way to manipulate emotions and even thoughts.
I should be aware of the dangerous side of music.
