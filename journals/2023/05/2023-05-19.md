I was continuously getting information forwarded from The Washington Post, so I decided to use it directly.
The first year of subscription is exceptionally acceptable ($29.9 instead of $70).
It's quality content was great, I like it's way of labeling opinions from reports and inline hyperlinks to references.
The audio service could be impressive, if the AI can read it more naturally.
