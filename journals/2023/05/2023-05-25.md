Other then replacement of water, gas syringe is another way of collecting gas, and it's much easier then replacing water.
By skipping a number of setups required by the water method, experiments could proceed quickly.
The drawback is, gas syringe is way less accurate. Mostly due to friction on the pistol, change in volume of gas will not be responded in real-time.
Though that does not affect my experiments very much as there's not need to be that accurate.
