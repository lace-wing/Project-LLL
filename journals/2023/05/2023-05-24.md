## Words
**LGBTQ** is an acronym that stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (or Questioning). It represents a diverse range of sexual orientations and gender identities. Here is a breakdown of the terms within the acronym:

- **Lesbian**: Refers to women who are attracted to other women.
- **Gay**: Primarily used to describe men who are attracted to other men, but it can also encompass all individuals attracted to the same gender.
- **Bisexual**: Refers to individuals who are attracted to both men and women.
- **Transgender**: Describes individuals whose gender identity differs from the sex assigned to them at birth.
- **Queer** (or **Questioning**): An umbrella term used to describe individuals who identify as not exclusively heterosexual or cisgender, or those who are still exploring and questioning their sexual orientation or gender identity.

The acronym is often expanded to LGBTQ+ or LGBTQIA+ to be more inclusive of other identities and orientations, such as intersex, asexual, and more. It is important to note that the terminology and definitions can vary, and individuals may identify with different terms or combinations thereof. Respect for individual self-identifications and preferences is essential when discussing LGBTQ+ topics.
