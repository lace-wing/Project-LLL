# A Shell!

Today I discovered a powerful iOS/iPadOS app named 'a-Shell'.
As a shell, it allows users to navigate through out the public space as well as other apps' sandboxes, which quite unleashes users' file-editing power. Not to mention it has integrated libgit2, ffmpeg, TexLive, and Vim... open-source, free and extendable. iPads and even iPhones are enabled with productivity similar to PCs, to a limited extend, of course.
