By nature of human, or most animals, we learn from things happened in the pasted, so-called experience, to plan for our future.
Recent emerging events make me rethink on this statement.
Seems like this learning mechanism isn't functioning well.
A thing happened today will take effect at least twice:
the first time is itself, the second time is for people to redo it tomorrow.

# Phrase
"**Play the two ends against the middle**" is an idiomatic expression that means **to manipulate or exploit two opposing parties or forces for one's own advantage**. It refers to a strategic approach where someone capitalizes on the differences or conflicts between two opposing sides to achieve their desired outcome. By pitting the two ends against each other, they divert attention or resources away from themselves and maintain a position of control or advantage. This phrase is often used to describe a tactic employed in various contexts, such as negotiations, politics, or interpersonal relationships, where one leverages the divisions or conflicts between others to achieve their own objectives.
